# Adress-Book-Management-System
First trial work of the module "Introduction to operating systems 2" involving the development of an adress book management system in 8086 assembly language.
  
This file is written in 8086 assembly. As such, to execute the program you will need the adequate application. I personnaly used emu8086 for both editing and executing my program, and I don't know if there is another applicaiton capable of doing so. So i would recommend [Emu8086](https://emu8086-microprocessor-emulator.fr.softonic.com/).
